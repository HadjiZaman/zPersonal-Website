		      <ul>
		              <li>CLEANING<br>I turned cleaning into a
  		               hobby because it is my first task  everyday<br>
		               and actually kinda loving it. It is easy to
                      say that this is fun<br>when you enjoy it.
                      Cleaning help clean and organized my stuff.<br>
                      It is a whole lot easier to find something or
		              going somewhere without<br>something blocking
                   	  your way. It helps increase productivity.</li>
		              <li>DRAWING<br>Drawing is my hobby sometimes
		              I used this to make my Art projects<br>and there are
		              times  i used this to draw something.<br> This
		              hobby of mine is my favorite one because I love to<br>
		              draw and design things that I can think of.
		              Drawing increases<br>creativity and productivity.</li>
		              <li>PLAYING VIDEO GAMES<br>It was my first hobby
		              when I was little until now. I know<br>that these
		              seem a waste of time, but the roles and rules of the<br>
		              video game can actually make you more productive
                      because it encourage<br>focus, teamwork, determination
                      trying over and over again even it’s your first time, and<br>
                      cooperation. These are useful to make you more driven
                      and prductive.</li>
